# Haar-Feature-Object-Recognition-and-Manipulation
This is Image-Processing-Based Object Recognition and Manipulation with a 5-DOF Smart Robotic Arm through a Smartphone Interface Using Human Intent Sensing, and the image processing contains haar cascade and affine transformation.
It also includes a class `Classifier` which is the `cascade_classification` trained from OpenCV C++ Cascade Classifier Training.
The whole recognition, picking and placing process show in following video:
